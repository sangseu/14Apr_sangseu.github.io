  I’m Denise O’Connor. I work for an advertising company in Dublin. I’m responsible for all printed publicity material that the company produces, such as leaflets and brochures. It’s my job to ensure that we give our clients the best printed advertising possible. I love my work because it’s interesting and the people I work with are great fun.
